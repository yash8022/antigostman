## <a id="why-antigostman"></a>🌟 Why Antigostman?

We believe tools should respect your resources. Antigostman is built with **pure Java Swing**, delivering a snappy, responsive experience that uses a fraction of the memory of Electron-based alternatives.

## <a id="key-features"></a>🔥 Key Features

### 📡 **Professional Request Builder**
*   **Complete Control**: Support for `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`.
*   **Modern Protocols**: Seamlessly toggle between **HTTP/1.1** and **HTTP/2**.
*   **Smart Downloads**: Check the `DL Content` box and let our intelligent **file detection** (powered by Apache Tika) handle the rest.

### 🧠 **Advanced Automation**
*   **Scripting Engine**: Write `JavaScript` pre-request and test scripts securely.
*   **Dynamic Content**: Powered by **Apache Velocity** for advanced variablisation. Use well-formed expressions like `$!{auth_token}` or `{{base_url}}` to inject dynamic data anywhere in your requests.
*   **Console Debugging**: A built-in terminal to inspect your logic in real-time.

### 📊 **Beautiful Reporting**
*   **One-Click PDF**: Generate stunning PDF reports of your test runs.
*   **Email Integration**: Send reports directly via **Outlook** or **Thunderbird** without leaving the app.

### 🎨 **Designed for Developers**
*   **Theme Aware**: Automatically adapts to **Light** or **Dark** environments.
*   **Syntax Highlighting**: Rich coloring for JSON, XML, properties, and more.
*   **Project Management**: Save your workspaces as portable XML files.
*   **Postman Migration**: Seamlessly import existing **Postman Collections (v2 & v2.1)** with full support for requests, folders, and scripts.

## 💎 Special Credits

This project was brought to life with the incredible assistance of **Google Antigravity** 🚀, the agentic AI coding assistant from Google DeepMind.

**~95% of Antigostman's base code** was collaboratively written with Antigravity, demonstrating the power of human-AI pair programming. From architecture decisions to feature implementation, Antigravity helped transform ideas into production-ready code at remarkable speed.

*Building the future, one commit at a time.* 🤖✨
